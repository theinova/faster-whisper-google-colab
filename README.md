Why faster-whisper? Because it's faster than the openai whisper implementation in python. Read guillaumekln/faster-whisper for details.

Create a folder on google drive, for example: audio

Load your mp3 files into the folder.

Run colab, the results will be saved in the output folder.

I use the LARGE for multilang model, use other models for faster work. (tiny, base, small etc. if you need only english language)

This only works with mp3 format. I do it for me. If you need other formats try to use this code in chatgpt or email me.

Why mp3? I used this format to transcribe youtube videos because this format weighs less to store on google drive.

Use youtube-dl or 4kdownloader

In any case it's made only for myself. Enjoy!
